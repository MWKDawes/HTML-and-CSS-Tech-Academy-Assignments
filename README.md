## Project Descriptions

### Portfolio
This is a project I intend to work on and update throughout my learning experience with new features and code I can utilize to make it more enjoyable. So far, I utilized multiple HTML elements, including links to outside sources for fonts, along with some css properties to create a visually pleasing layout.

### Legend of Zelda Fan Site
Utilizing some extra time I created a fan website for the video game Legend of Zelda. The game series has always been a favorite of mine and I was excited to use my new coding skills to create this.

### Cinema Website
This is a website that I created utilizing the Bootstrap4 application. The overall color designs and images were provided by the instructor of the course but no part of the code was copied/pasted or anything of the like.
