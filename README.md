### Legend of Zelda Fan Site
Utilizing some extra time I created a fan website for the video game Legend of Zelda. The game series has always been a favorite of mine and I was excited to use my new coding skills to create this.

### Cinema Website
This is a website that I created utilizing the Bootstrap4 application. The overall color designs and images were provided by the instructor of the course but no part of the code was copied/pasted or anything of the like.
